# Neural LOLgorithm: Deep Learning for Multi-Modal Comedy Data (June 2023)

This repository delves into the world of humor detection using deep learning techniques. The project, titled "Neural LOLgorithm," explores the application of multi-modal analysis to assess the humor quotient of various stimuli.

## Project Overview

The Neural LOLgorithm proposes a novel approach to humor detection by:

- **Humor Quotient Score:** Introducing a humor quotient (HQ) score that rates humor on a 10-point scale. This score is derived from a formula based on the cumulative laughter intensity measured using deep learning and feature engineering techniques.
- **Multi-Modal Processing:** Employing Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) layers to process various data modalities, including:
    - Textual Embeddings: Extracting semantic meaning from textual content (e.g., jokes, captions)
    - Audio Features: Analyzing audio cues like laughter intensity and pitch variations
    - Video Keypoints: Leveraging keypoint detection (e.g., facial expressions) from video data

## Technical Stack

The project utilizes a combination of deep learning libraries and tools to achieve its goals. Here's a breakdown of the key technologies:

- **Deep Learning Framework:** PyTorch (likely used for building and training the neural network model)
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Libraries for text processing and embedding creation (e.g., spaCy, Gensim)
- **Computer Vision:** Libraries for video keypoint detection (e.g., OpenPose)
- **Audio Analysis:** Libraries for extracting audio features (e.g., OpenSmile)
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) scores are used to assess the model's performance.

## Key Achievements

The Neural LOLgorithm demonstrates promising results in humor detection using a multi-modal approach. The Bi-LSTM architecture, coupled with the combination of textual, audio, and visual features, achieves QWK scores ranging from 0.691 to 0.813.

## Potential Applications

This project has the potential to be applied in various domains, such as:

- **Recommender Systems:** Recommending comedic content (e.g., stand-up routines, funny videos) based on user preferences.
- **Content Creation:** Assisting content creators in crafting more humorous material by analyzing humor elements.
- **Social Media Analysis:** Understanding the humor dynamics within social media interactions.
- **Educational Technology:** Developing interactive learning experiences that incorporate humor for better engagement.
